## Canadian Crop data EDA

### Overview

This project, a **final model task in an IBM course**, involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets related to Canadian agriculture and financial exchange rates using `rSQLite` 

### Datasets

1. **Annual Crop Data**:
   - **Description**: Agricultural production measures for principal crops in Canada (1908-2020).
   - **Source**: [StatsCan Data Portal](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3210035901)

2. **Monthly Farm Prices**:
   - **Description**: Monthly average prices for various farm products across different Canadian regions.
   - **Source**: Custom preprocessed dataset.

3. **Daily Foreign Exchange Rates (Daily_FX)**:
   - **Description**: Daily average exchange rates for foreign currencies, focused on USD-CAD over the latest four years.
   - **Source**: [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/daily-exchange-rates)

4. **Monthly Foreign Exchange Rates (Monthly_FX)**:
   - **Description**: Monthly average exchange rates for foreign currencies.
   - **Source**: Custom preprocessed dataset.

I might update this file if I decide to explore it further which I already did during the time of completing it.
